# sustainable-events
Events, whether they are virtual or in-person, have a significant footprint on the environment. They are vital for organizations, customers, industries, and communities to network, make announcements, offer educational opportunities, increase sales and account support, and provide opportunities for connection.   To comply with and support sustainable and zero-waste commitments, intentional practices must be implemented to events and community-driven experiences. Sustainability must be fully integrated into the strategy, planning, programming, logistics, operations, and execution. Additionally, diversity, equity, inclusivity, and environmental justice must be prioritized by generating significant impact through awareness, community-driven initiatives, and commitments.
