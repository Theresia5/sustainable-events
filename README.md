# Sustainable Events & Experiences Playbook

Events, whether they are virtual or in-person, have a significant footprint on the environment. They are vital for organizations, customers, industries, and communities to network, make announcements, offer educational opportunities, increase sales and account support, and provide opportunities for connection.   

To comply with and support sustainable and zero-waste commitments, intentional practices must be implemented to events and community-driven experiences. Sustainability must be fully integrated into the strategy, planning, programming, logistics, operations, and execution. Additionally, diversity, equity, inclusivity, and environmental justice must be prioritized by generating significant impact through awareness, community-driven initiatives, and commitments.
  
## Usage

Utilize this repository to reference the [Sustainable Events & Experiences Playbook](./playbook.md) to learn best practices. A [Code of Conduct](./sustainable-event-code-of-conduct.md) is included, since a Code of Conduct should be published for any in-person or virtual experience, no matter the audience or subject matter.

## Why

Experiences, events, and productions have a significant impact on the environment and the communities living in it. Here you will find the resources to support planning, communicating, and executing sustainable practices for anything from large conferences, tradeshows, productions, and virtual experiences.

## What's Included

* [sustainable-event-code-of-conduct.md](./sustainable-event-code-of-conduct.md)
  * A Code of Conduct specifies a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and cultures can communicate effectively, productively, and respectfully. This is imperative at both in-person and virtual events. The Code of Conduct included within this repository can be used for online experiences to both protect and inform the audience of the standards of behavior the organizers require to participate.
* [playbook.md](./playbook.md)
  * As the organizers and contributors of the technology industryâ€™s most impactful events and community experiences, we need to take a collaborative approach to address the shift to more virtual and online experiences due to COVID-19. Utilize the playbook to review the different types of digital experiences, key digital event elements, virtual event standards and requirements, and additional resources and best practices.
