# Code of Conduct for Sustainable & Inclusive Events
All events must have a Code of Conduct to support and enforce inclusive and respectful event experiences. The Code of Conduct applies to the attendees, but also to our shared, global environment. 

## For Organizers

As event and experience organizers, we seek to provide a **respectful, friendly, professional experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, age, race or religion**. We do not tolerate any behavior that is degrading to any gender, race, sexual orientation, or disability, or any behavior that would be deemed harassment or discrimination. Individuals are responsible for knowing and abiding by our standards and we encourage everyone to assist in creating a welcoming and safe environment. 

## Our Values
