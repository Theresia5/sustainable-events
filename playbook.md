# Sustainable Events & Experiences Playbook 

## Impactful Experiences
Events, whether they are virtual or in-person, have a significant footprint on the environment. They are vital for organizations, customers, industries, and communities to network, make announcements, offer educational opportunities, increase sales and account support, and provide opportunities for connection. 

To comply with and support sustainable and zero-waste commitments, intentional practices must be implemented to events and community-driven experiences. Sustainability must be fully integrated into the strategy, planning, programming, logistics, operations, and execution. Additionally, diversity, equity, inclusivity, and environmental justice must be prioritized by generating significant impact through awareness, community-driven initiatives, and commitments.

**Please note that all experiences are not one-size-fits-all. Elements may require slight modification based on the audience, content, and desired outcome from the expereince, event, or large-scale production. This playbook represents a set of strategies that have been found successful.**

## Sustainable Hybrid Event Strategy & Process
Key strategies to implement sustainable event practices:
*	First, **trust and transparency are key**. “Greenwashing” is misleading, creates mistrust with our customers and community, and suppresses the ability to innovate and improve. 
*	Second, the efforts must be collaborative and **require commitment from all parties** involved in event production – venues, vendors, event teams, content creators, stakeholders, and attendees. 
*	Third, **virtually accessible offerings must be prioritized** when possible. 
*	Lastly, pursue the following commitments with verified partners:
    *	**Zero waste**: make deep reductions first and foremost, then use removal for the residual footprint and beyond.
    * **Carbon negativity**: remove more carbon than emitted each year. 
      * **Carbon neutrality**: reduce emissions and/or pays others to not emit an equivalent to their remaining emissions. 

## Intentional Pre-planning Efforts
* Systematically review the options of in-person only, virtual only, or a hybrid approach when determining how to engage with the event participants.
  * In-person events:
    * Pros: face-to-face networking, increased engagement with less multitasking
    * Considerations: sustainable travel, less time to plan accordingly since attendees are making plan on average 30 days prior, COVID compliance
  * Virtual-only events:
    * Pros: flexible and accessible by design, cost-effective, global participation, less impactful on the environment
    * Considerations: distractions, technical, hardware, and internet reliability required, lacks in-person engagement
  * Hybrid events:
    * Pros: realtime agility for the organizers and attendees, increased reach and attendance, reduced environmental impact than fully in-person experiences, qualitative and quantitative data
    * Considerations: high cost to offer essentially two events, requires internal design for hybrid event interaction
* Clearly define the goals, objectives, and key performance indicators (KPIs) when crafting a carbon negative event from the beginning.
  * Start with sustainability in mind – from awareness to execution.
    * If in-person, offer equally important digital venue options for attendees. By offering a hybrid in-person and digital event experience, you will minimize the environmental impact while also advocating for more inclusive participation.
  *	Pick teams, partners, and individuals to help support.
  *	Develop a clear plan to apply these playbook practices to a real-world event.
  *	Track your progress, measure results, and be completely transparent.
    * Note: If the event does not meet the goals or errors are later discovered, be honest about that and learn from that for the next event. Transparency and honesty is more important than getting it right every time.
  *	Tell the story with your colleagues, customers, and future event partners.
* Incorporate brevity throughout communications, meetings, and planning. Concise and effective communication practices lower the environmental footprint for preplanning and helps support clarity and collaboration.
  * On average “small” emails (short, no attachments) emit 4g CO2e, “large” emails (long, with attachments) emit 50g CO2e. 
    * Reference: The Carbon Cost of an Email - The Carbon Literacy Project.
    * Learn more about being brief: Blog | The Brief Lab.
      * Effective Meetings:
        * Share agenda in advance with goals, actions, expectations.
        * Ask people to prepare and co-own portions of the agenda.
        * Take notes, manage action items, and provide quick recaps.
      * Effective Emails:
        * Start emails with a clear headline
        * Limit unnecessary details and link to documentation for those that want to learn more.
        * Bullet key priorities and takeaways.
        * Reread the email before sending to ensure it can be read and understood in a few minutes.
  * Cloud storage for assets, documentation, contracts, and meeting recordings can average about 100g CO2e for one year.
    * Reference: eGRID2018 Summary Tables (epa.gov) & Carbon Footprint of Cloud Storage.
  * Depending on the device, network connection, and resolution, recording and streaming video emits 36g CO2e per hour. 
    * Reference: The carbon footprint of streaming video: fact-checking the headlines – Analysis - IEA.

* Get certified as a sustainable, zero-waste event by reporting GRI Standards. This assists with efforts around transparency, while also assisting with guidance and improvement areas.

## Key Strategies for Sustainable Events
Leverage the six Rs of sustainable consumption to guide you through the event planning process: 
1.	Rethink: are ways to modify to minimize environmental impact?
2.	Refuse: is this worth it or do I need this to succeed?
3.	Reduce: do I need this much and can I use less?
4.	Reuse: do I have to throw it away now or can it be used again?
5.	Repair: can I fix it rather than throw it away?
6.	Recycle: can the materials be used again for something else?
7.	[OPTIONAL] Reward: how to get attendees involved to grow awareness, collaboration, and commitment?

Here are some examples of ways to apply the six Rs to sustainable events:
* Reduce: What generates impact and return, and what does not? If not, remove it!
  * Physical documentation: use applications and collaborative digital tools to eliminate the need for paper and physical documentation. This applies to attendee “take-aways” and “print outs” as well. This can all be offered digitally, which still generates impact, but less than the latter.
  * Swag: Examine your use of swag at events and the value the items truly provide to the attendee and the event’s goal. Ask yourself if the swag is sustainably sourced, if the items serve a purpose towards lowering your footprint (eg: water bottles to use during the event and keep post-event), can the offerings be served digitally instead (eg: wellness memberships), and outline your plan for excess donations and/or recycling. 
    * Virtual swag provides flexibility for the attendees to choose what is relevant to them and when they want to access the swag. 
    * Attendees should work or engage to earn swag.
    * Sustainable, virtual swag can be low to no cost as well, like Teams backgrounds, Digital Kid Activity Books, and wellness guides. 
    * Ensure that the swag is relevant to the audience. 
  * Disposables: Single use items should be completely banned. Using washable or compostable cutlery, plates, cups for water stations, gloves, trash bags, name tags/lanyards, and more can support a zero-waste, environmentally friendly event experience.
* Reuse: What elements of an event are often repeated or deemed standard? How can they be reused?
  * Signage, structures, and decor: If sourced from a sustainable vendor, items can be reused for future events. By removing dates or key identifiers, items can be reused by other clients like directional signage to a restroom. Utilizing an event application can reduce the need for most signage all together. 
  * Leftover food and supplies: The donation of food cannot be an afterthought because it does require logistical planning and agreement across multiple partners. Clearly state with all parties that all unserved food will be donated. Work with local organizations or search for agencies using Hungerpedia or other hunger-fighting organizations.
  * Applications: Use the same templates, platforms, and applications as previous events. This will lower the amount of time spent recreating tools, while also lowering the environmental impact from software development.
* Recycle & Compost: Trash and waste should be eliminated from all events, otherwise, it will simply go to a landfill to leak gas into the atmosphere or pollute bodies of water. Stop this from happening by following the above reduce and reuse steps, while also only using recyclable and compostable items. Reference: EPA’s Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Program
  * Establish central collection points, place bins for different types of waste side by side, have signage available next to all necessary bins to help the attendee know what items go into what specific bin. Place bins throughout the venue (every room, every 300 ft) to avoid confusion or lack of resources.
  * Use this opportunity to further educate the attendee about the environmental impact they are helping reduce and how.
  * Work with the waste management groups to ensure that proper sorting and transporting practices will be applied to confirm all items go to the appropriate facility.
  * Quick definitions to help:
    * Biodegradable: All things made from organic matter are biodegradable, like banana peels, newspaper and even special biodegradable plastic called “PLA”. But things that are put into landfills don’t biodegrade for a very long time (e.g. you can still read a newspaper after 60 years in a landfill). And, while organic matter is very slowly degrading in landfills, it produces a greenhouse gas called methane. It also requires sunlight and oxygen to degrade, which is difficult when piled in dense landfills – making it basically obsolete. 
    * Compostable: Biodegradable organic matter that can be composted in a commercial composting facility and turned into compost (aka. nutrient rich soil). However, not all items labeled "biodegradable” are necessarily compostable, because some of these materials do not actually decompose fast enough for commercial composting. Work with vendors to ensure that all items are commercially compostable, properly collected at the venue, and brought to a composting facility. Reference: www.findacomposter.com. 
    * Recyclable: Assuming that “trash” has been eliminated as an option, recyclable items are still an unpreferred choice for materials at your event. Just because something can be recycled, it does not mean it will be recycled. Recyclable items can be used, but more work will be required to work with many various organizations to ensure that your items are truly recycled post-event. Plastic film, Styrofoam, and electronics are just examples of items that most-likely require an outside agency to assist with recycling. 
* Reward: Make it fun and get the attendees involved! 
  * Review the Philanthropic Contributions section as part of the Virtual Swag Offering
  * Sample Attendee Awareness Activities:
    * Sustainable Sunday
      * Inform and Educate. Share that sustainability is a priority and educate attendees on how they can contribute. Reenforce, recycle, reuse.
    * Meatless Monday
      * Focus on more plant-based fuel options for Monday menus. Share the impact that the meat industry has on the environment and small ways to start reducing said impact.
    * Transit-less Tuesday
      * Encourage attendees to think about alternative forms of transportation, i.e. encourage them to utilize the walking routes throughout campus instead of shuttles. Offer pedal-cabs and group walks.
    * Waste-less Wednesday
      * Remind about the waste-less items at the event. Share that their lanyard can be planted or composted after the event. Encourage people to share over social on how they wasted less.
    * Thirsty Thursday
      * Educate about water conservation and compostable cups and cutlery. Highlight that the reusable water bottles are either compostable or sustainably created for future use (ex: glass). 
    * Footprint Friday
      * Do something together to reduce the footprint of the event. Raise funds to plant trees, offset emissions through the destruction of refrigerants, and host sessions with limited power like round tables that do not require presentations.

## Key Strategies for Inclusive Events
An inclusive event experience must begin with an inclusive and diverse conference planning process. The efforts and impact must be intentional to successfully encourage various perspectives, amplify voices, increase innovation, diversify impact, and generate grander results. 
* Have a diverse planning committee organize the events.
  * Enlist various perspectives throughout the planning process to ensure nothing is overlooked and disregarded.
* Offer an objective and inclusive Call for Speakers / Call for Proposals process if applicable.
  * Use resources to include marginalized communities, first-time speakers, and a diverse pool of applicants to enhance representation and innovation at the event.
* Leverage an inclusive speaker selection process:
  * Provide multiple submission opportunities.
  * Offer the ability to rewrite and reassess submission abstracts.
  * Manage a nameless submission selection process that is solely based on content.
  * Have a diverse committee selecting the final speakers.
  * Provide support for new and inexperienced speakers including speaker readiness training, mentorship, and rehearsals.
  * Allow opportunities to pre-record sessions if necessary.
  * Commit to a broad demographic and representation of speakers and moderators that includes various gender identifications, ethnicities, religions, experience levels, abilities, sexual orientations, and native languages.
* Have a public-facing Code of Conduct and Code of Conduct Committee
* Include ways for individuals to distinctively and/or anonymously communicate preferences (ex: pronouns, dietary needs, physical requirements, mental requirements, allergies) during the registration process and on-site when applicable.
* Host workshops and sessions that address inclusive behavior, mentorship, wellness, and mental health.
* Offer diversity sponsorship and tickets options to cover conference admission costs and any other costs that may unintentionally act as a barrier to diverse demographics. 
* Perform a full diversity and inclusion audit post-event to find areas for improvement by seeking feedback from attendees and speakers, revise the Code of Conduct based on experienced behaviors, rewrite the Code of Conduct process based on experienced behaviors and challenges, review potential partners with relevant organizations and individuals, offer inclusivity training to staff, and be transparent about the metrics and improvement goals. 

## Code of Conduct
All events must have a Code of Conduct to support and enforce inclusive and respectful event experiences. The Code of Conduct applies to the attendees, but also to our shared, global environment. 

### Sample Code of Conduct:
We are committed towards offering a respectful and welcoming experience for everyone and our shared planet. Behavior that is deemed harassment, discrimination, or degrading to any gender, race, sexual orientation, physical appearance, age, religion, or disability will NOT be tolerated. Individuals are responsible for knowing and abiding by our standards and we encourage everyone to assist in creating a welcoming and safe environment.

By participating, you are committing to:
* Treat everyone and the planet with respect, kindness, and empathy.
* Use welcoming, inclusive, and thoughtful language.
* Reporting, not engaging in, and not demonstrating destructive or inflammatory behavior.
* Honor unique perspectives and differences.
* Prioritize sustainable activities and environmental practices.

Please report any questions, concerns, or disruptive activity or behavior to the organizing team, so that we can address the issue immediately.

## Vendor and Partner Selection
* Ask vendors about their sustainability practices
  * Request certifications, policies, processes, and any published sustainable content to verify the vendor is the correct, sustainable choice
    * Review: is sustainability mentioned on their website, what is their waste management criteria and specifications, who oversees waste management, do they repurpose or donate unused items, electrical sources, water use and management practices.
    * Proper certifications may include: The TRUE program for zero waste certification | TRUE (gbci.org), Certified Carbon Neutral, Certified Organic and Marine Stewardship Council Standards, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified, and commitments towards carbon offsetting. Reference: Sustainability Certifications: Which Can You Trust? - ethical.net.
  * Place specific, sustainability language in requests for proposals and contracts
    * Removes misunderstandings, assigns ownership, and illustrates the priority from the beginning 
  * Learn with the employee’s guide to sustainability
* Build the team and assign clear, documented roles and responsibilities. 
  * Use an accountability matrix to assign all planning and sustainability efforts
  * Track progress for sustainability efforts specifically during each planning meeting. Communicate potential challenges, required support or funding, and assess opportunities and risks
    * Share progress with relevant stakeholders to consistently craft the story around the event and the reduction or elimination of environmental impact
* Event Registration, Platform, and Application: A digitally accessible registration process is key in lowering environmental footprint. Additionally, having all check-in, on-demand content, and FAQ information in one place will lower the amount of correspondence from the attendees and a better user experience.
  * Software & Platform Review:
    * Do they have a sustainability commitment? 
    * Is the platform or product carbon neutral and net zero? Carbon negative?
    * What platform are they running on/where are they hosting? On Google or Azure?

## CO2e Calculations & Communications for Events
Consider the pre-planning efforts that generate emissions like software development, emails, data storage, design work, remote work, and video meetings. Calculate the data storage and device use from speakers and hosts recorded rehearsals, pre-recorded sessions, as well as the estimated number of live attendees, annual on-demand viewers, and network quality.
* Virtual Event Calculator: Calculate the event’s environmental impact to address all greenhouse gas emission types including Scope 1 (direct emissions/organizer generated), Scope 2 (indirect emissions/electricity and energy use) and Scope 3 (other indirect emissions/attendee generated).
* Carbon Offsetting vs. Carbon Removal 
  * Carbon offsetting and emission avoidance
    * A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide, or another greenhouse gas made to compensate for emissions made elsewhere, by funding actions like planting trees. For example, an individual might purchase carbon offsets to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel.
    * Emission avoidance is estimated as the emissions avoided by changing the process to prioritize the reduction of greenhouse gas or destroying existing items that would be harmful to the environment if left unchecked. 
    * Carbon Tax is the price applied to each metric ton of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and have been identified as the most effective way to reduce global emissions. 
  * We cannot meet our carbon negative commitment without carbon removal. Reducing value chain emissions, supporting efficient business practices, and partnering with environmentally sustainable partners is the first step. In addition, we must pledge to remove existing carbon from the atmosphere to avoid a climate catastrophe. 
    * Key points to prioritize when selecting a carbon removal vendor:
      * Net negativity: Go beyond the standards placed today to fully vet net negativity. Remove net atmospheric carbon dioxide on a life-cycle basis, including the following consideration, with conservative assumptions regarding uncertainty:
        * Additionality, durability, avoidance of leakage, and clear removal attributes, as opposed to emissions avoided and/or reduced.
      * Scientific verification: All projects, regardless of certification status, must go through a comprehensive independent review of project documents and underlying scientific studies to assess the extent to which they fulfill the necessary criteria. 
      * Avoidance of harm: Avoid or minimize environmental and social harm (harmful examples: continued reliance on fossil fuel energy, deforestation, water consumption, impact to indigenous/local rights, lack of biodiversity, and violation of national sovereignty and social equity). 
      * Additional factors to consider when reviewing vendors: global potential, affordability (average removal cost is $15/mCO2e), climate equity, technology innovation, waste reduction, biodiversity protection, and water stewardship.
* Messaging and transparency are very important when addressing environmental issues. Show your math, highlight potential errors or risk, celebrate successes, and disclose areas for improvement.
  * Identify if the event is committed towards “avoided emissions,” “carbon removal,” or other forms of environmental impact so that the message or outcome is very clear.
* Post-Event Reporting:
  * Highlight the main goals outlined at the very beginning of the planning process. 
    * Goal 1: Eliminate waste and prioritize compostable or reusable items. 
    * Goal 2: Ban the use of any single-use plastic.
      * Potential Partner: Seven Clean Seas for plastic-offsetting.
    * Goal 3: Offset and remove all carbon emissions x 10 by working with a verified and certified vendor to issue carbon credits. 
      * Potential Partner: Tradewater for avoided emissions.
    * Goal 4: Offer only digital swag and have one piece of “swag” inspire environmental awareness. 
      * Potential Partner: Ecosia – Gift a Tree Program.
  * Share planning documents and tracking measures used to monitor progress from start to finish. These documents can be shared on GitHub to be used by other planners and organizations as well.
    * Discuss energy efficiency, water efficiency, air quality, transportation practices, waste reduction, food donation and supply chain modifications, and any other environmental, economic, and inclusive indicators.
  * Highlight goals met, potential risks, and areas for improvement. For risks and areas for improvement, include ways the team will assess these results and proposed actions to improve. Be transparent if the team is unsure about a specific solution and outline the research and partnerships required to learn more.
  * Provide opportunities for attendee feedback, specifically about sustainability. This can be done through a form or email alias. If possible, reply to feedback and place all feedback in a retrospective for future team review.
